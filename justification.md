# Justification for changed design goals

## Aesthetics

We wanted our game to have elements of discovery and submission, letting the player explore a physical world and discovering different fish from there. 

Our game still has some discovery in the different species of fish, but when we started developement we decided to focus on the battle mechanics and abandoning the physical world part, as it would have been too much for these 2 weeks we had to develop the game.

We also wanted the battle part to be a bit of a challenge, where the user has to plan their actions and use items to catch the fish. 

## Mechanics

Originally, we wanted the player to need to use bait in some way to catch fish. However, we thought it would be simpler for the player to have one objective: defeating the fish. So our updated plan for the catching was to have the player defeat the fish to catch it, and using the bait as just another item to use in defeating the fish.

## Dynamics

We decided to slowly increase the difficulty (by increasing the fish health and strength) to make the game more interesting for players. The player also has the ability to increase their own strength and health, so the game involves the player trying to keep up with the strength of the fish. The player also loses some progress (items, coins and upgrades) when losing to a fish, so the player has more incentive to not lose.
