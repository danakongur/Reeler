# Justification for changed design goals

## Aesthetics

We wanted our game to have elements of discovery and submission, letting the player explore a physical world and discovering different fish from there. Our game still has some discovery in the different species of fish, but when we started developement we decided to focus on the battle mechanics and abandoning the physical world part, as it would have been too much for these 2 weeks we had to develop the game.

## Mechanics

bla bla minna catch fish og meira murder fish lol
